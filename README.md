# ESGF Publisher

`v5.1.0b10` is the latest Pre-release version of the ESGF Publisher.  We recommend everyone to upgrade and test this version for CMIP6 data.

See: https://esg-publisher.readthedocs.io/en/latest

### Release notes:

#### v5.1.0-b9,10

* CRTICAL: esgunpublish checks dataset id argument for publication prior to unpublication to prevent server-side erroneus deletions.
* Improved Controlled-vocabulary agreement checks and upgraded rules (for CMIP6)
* Bug fix for input4MIPs (omit CMOR tables load)

#### v5.1.0-b8

* Change ``set-replica`` semantics with respect to PrePARE and add ``force_prepare`` option
   - default behavior is to run PrePARE for non-replica but not for replica
   - with ``force_prepare=True``, PrePARE is *always* run
* esgunpublish now unpublishes PID from handle database
* Allow for custom gridftp ports (specify with ``<hostname>:<port>``)
* Correct file instance_id and master_id

#### v5.1.0-b7

* Bug fix and refactoring: improved data root handling for paths that contain multiple instances of the project name in the path
* Bug fix for the skip_prepare argument (applies to CMIP6 replica publishing to bypass PrePARE)
* Feature to ensure that file tracking_ids are never duplicated within a dataset

#### v5.1.0b6

* **CRITICAL:** corrected File record ID format to include |data_node to conform to prior specification
* Support for data root specifications that include the project string in the root
* Bug fixes: citiaton case for command line project path, support tilde for homedir in cmor path property in config file

#### v5.1.0b5

* Update to support input4MIPs project
* Added `--version` argument
* Additonal arguments for esgunpublish
* Halt publishing if a file listed in the mapfile isnâ€™t found by autocurator (it will not through an error as)

#### v5.1.0b1

* Refactored classses for improved code reuse (among other features)
* `--no-auth` mode for testing with esgf-docker publisher API


#### v5.0.0a12

* Cleans up output (verbose, silent) modes for some of the functionality

#### v5.0.0a11 

* Corrects error with activity check

#### v5.0.0a10
