esgmapconv
==========

The ``esgmapconv`` command executes the first step of the publishing protocol by converting metadata from a mapfile into json data.
That data is the input to the ``esgmkpubrec`` command.

Usage
-----

``esgmapconv`` is used with the following syntax::

    esgmapconv --map <mapfile>

where ``<mapfile>`` is the absolute path to a single mapfile. The output will be printed to stdout, but can be easily redirected to a chosen file using the ``--out-file`` option.

You can also use the other command line options for additional configuration::

    usage: esgmapconv [-h] [--project PROJ] --map MAP [--out-file OUT_FILE]

    Publish data sets to ESGF databases.

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help           show this help message and exit
        --project PROJ       Set/overide the project for the given mapfile, for use with selecting the DRS or specific features, e.g. PrePARE, PID.
        --map MAP            Mapfile ending in .map extension, contains metadata about the record.
        --out-file OUT_FILE  Output file for map data in JSON format. Default is printed to standard out.

Using the command line option ``-h`` will display the above message.
The above options (excluding ``--map``) can be defined in the config file instead of the command line if you choose.
