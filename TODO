TODO:
-Write fetch script for esg core jars
  ->(Instead) Integrate in Ivy for dependency fetching
  ->Create own Ivy repositories one for "dev" another for "prod".

-Write a MainTest.java file to be the MainClass: in test jar so that
 end users can download the test jar and just run it and thus run the
 tests. (don't have to use ant it should just work right out of the
 box)

-JUnit - get it to conditionally do tests for only the code that has
 failed or is not uptodate

-bring over up-to-date publisher python code
